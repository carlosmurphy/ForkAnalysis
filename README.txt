Tool for using IMUs to determine suspension dynamics in a mountain bike fork
Also included are some simulation tools that will allow VERY rough simulation of fork dynamics

---Simulation---
This is mainly for sanity checking when looking at IMU data and making sure things are within
worst case kind of readings
